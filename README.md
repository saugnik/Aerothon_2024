🚀 Aerothon Competition Projects
Welcome to my GitHub! This repository (or profile section) showcases my contributions to the Aerothon competition, where I worked on a multidisciplinary UAV design and mission planning challenge. My work spanned across:

✈️ CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)

🛠 CAD Design

📍 Mission Planner Integration

🤖 Machine Learning

🔧 Project Roles and Contributions
1. 🧪 Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
Conducted airflow simulations around UAV models using tools like ANSYS Fluent / OpenFOAM.

Optimized aerodynamic surfaces for drag reduction and lift improvement.

Validated CFD results against design requirements for stability and performance.

2. 🛩 CAD Design
Designed and iterated 3D models of UAVs in SolidWorks / Fusion 360.

Focused on weight optimization, manufacturability, and modular design.

Worked closely with CFD team to align physical design with simulation results.

3. 🗺 Mission Planner
Integrated UAV autopilot systems using Mission Planner and QGroundControl.

Planned autonomous routes with GPS waypoints for different mission profiles.

Tuned PID parameters and assisted in flight testing simulations.

4. 🧠 Machine Learning
Built ML models for:

Obstacle detection / route optimization.

Predictive analysis for battery usage and endurance.

Used Python with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and custom datasets generated from simulation and mission data.
